All-time highs of nearly $65k will be the next resistance level before a potential price discovery phase. While the BTC price has fiercely rallied over the past few weeks, bitcoin balance on exchanges remains at the lowest levels in nine months, indicating investors are holding bitcoin in wallets rather than readying themselves to sell.\\n\\nHow high could bitcoin price go?\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 13:31 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nDepending on who you ask, the answer to this question can range from $0 to north of $1 million.\\n\\nBut separating the so-called FUDsters from the Moon Boys are the more realistic crypto analysts, who put bitcoins price within a window of between $10,000 and $250,000 over the next year.\\n\\nOne of the most accurate forecasts made in recent months comes from the pseudonymous Dutch analyst PlanB, who predicted in June the price of bitcoin in August and September to within less than a third of a per cent.\\n\\nAccording to PlanBs worst case scenario, bitcoin will be at $63,000 at the end of October, before shooting up to $98,000 in November and $135,000 in December.

Heres what he had to say:\\n\\nThe $6.7 trillion US ETF industry is the largest market in the world  bitcoin frenzy may reach new heights in the near future.\\n\\nApproving futures-based bitcoin ETFs will be seen as a forward-thinking move by the SEC and could lead to a bullish run. Given the size of the US ETF industry and current positivity in the market, following Chinas ban being put behind the public, El Salvadors good will  using surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust for noble purposes and the emergence of India as the country with most crypto users, among other reasons, I believe not only will bitcoin cross $60,000 but also break its all-time high this month and potentially surpass $65,000 by the end of the month.\\n\\nUnless some barriers to growth appear in the latter stages of the year, bitcoin is poised to reach $75,000 by the end of the year.\\n\\nGreg Waisman, Mercuryo\\n\\nBitcoin price set for record-breaking end to 2021?\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 10:45 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nOctober has historically been a positive month for bitcoin, averaging 13 per cent gains since 2011, though this is just a fraction of the price increase typically seen in November.\\n\\nWith nearly a 40 per cent price rise in October already, bitcoin is vastly outperforming the precedent.\\n\\nWere still only halfway through October, but if bitcoin stays at its current price and then replicates the average gains of previous years, it will reach six figures before Christmas.

Could we be in for a record-breaking end to 2021? It would take only one more sudden surge, like the one we saw earlier this morning, for BTC to hit a new all-time high - though some are warning that mania could once again be creeping into the market, signalling a dip could also be on its way at some point.\\n\\nBitcoin ETF news sends price of crypto soaring\\n\\nBitcoin price surges, closing in on record high\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 06:51 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nThe price of bitcoin is now less than $5,000 away from its all-time high, after suddenly shooting up from below $57,000 to close to $60,000 on Friday morning.\\n\\nThe gains come off the back of a report that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to approve the launch of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\\n\\nThis would be a massive step forward for bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, who have been calling for a bitcoin ETF approval for years.\\n\\nThe official Twitter account from the SECs investor education office also hinted that an announcement was imminent, tweeting about the risks of trading bitcoin futures contracts.\\n\\nBefore investing in a fund that holds Bitcoin futures contracts, make sure you carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nCheck out our Investor Bulletin to learn more: https://t.co/AZbrkpfn8F\\n\\n SEC Investor Ed (@SEC_Investor_Ed) October 14, 2021\\n\\nDogecoin price spikes after Elon Musk tweets\\n\\nThursday 14 October 2021 15:04 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nElon Musk has once again sent the price of dogecoin soaring after trading tweets with the cryptocurrencys founder, Billy Markus.\\n\\nThe meme-inspired crypto shot up nearly 10 per cent after Musk replied with the 100 emoji after Markus tweeted, if you dont run a dogecoin node, you are satan.\\n\\nThe centibillionaire also posted a crying face emoji to a meme posted by Markus, inspired by hit Netflix show Squid Game.\\n\\n\\n\\n Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2021\\n\\nAs the richest person in the world, Musk revealed earlier this year that beyond Tesla stock and his share of ownership in SpaceX, cryptocurrency is the only thing of significant value that he owns.\\n\\nThe only ones he has admitted to personally owning are bitcoin, Ethereum (ether) and, you guessed it, dogecoin.

That equates to more than $100 billion.\\n\\nWeve heard from the UK head of the Luno cryptocurrency exchange this morning, who offers his thoughts on why bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies are surging.\\n\\nThe rising expectations for a bitcoin ETF shown by rising open interest, and growing basis premiums for CMEs futures may be a cause of the bullish momentum. CMEs share of the global open interest in the bitcoin futures also reached 17 per cent this week  the highest level recorded since February 2021 suggesting institutional traders have returned to bitcoin.\\n\\nSam Kopelman, Luno\\n\\nBitcoin price slides but Binance Coin skyrockets\\n\\nWednesday 13 October 2021 11:24 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nThe price of bitcoin has now slipped below $55,000, though other leading cryptocurrencies are seeing a major resurgence.\\n\\nBinance Coin is now up more than 16 per cent since this time yesterday, while Polkadot and Uniswap are both up by more than 7 per cent.\\n\\nThe latest gains have pushed Binance Coins price above $450  less than $200 away from its all-time high  and means its market cap is now close to $80 billion.\\n\\nThe reason for the price surge appears to be the introduction of a $1 billion fund that Binance claims will be the biggest growth fund in the history or crypto.\\n\\nUS overtakes China for bitcoin mining\\n\\nWednesday 13 October 2021 09:51 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nFor the first time ever, the US has overtaken China to become the top destination for bitcoin miners.\\n\\nNew data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows that one third of bitcoins hashrate is now in the US, following a 428 per cent increase since September 2020.\\n\\nThe shift comes after Chinas massive crackdown on mining operations in the country, which wiped out roughly half of all bitcoin miners.\\n\\nCheap energy and vast renewable power sources has made the US an attractive destination for miners, though it still doesnt command the same dominance in the sector as China once did. Analysts see the spreading out of market share as a major positive for bitcoin and should ultimately reduce big price fluctuations as no single country can have a significant impact on the sector through introducing new legislation.\\n\\nBitcoin advocates share long-term trading strategy\\n\\nWednesday 13 October 2021 07:15 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nTwo of the most high-profile bitcoin advocates have offered their advice on cryptocurrency trading.\\n\\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who has ploughed billions of the companys cash reserves into bitcoin, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have both said they do not look at short-term price swings.\\n\\nInstead, CZ advises to focus on the long term, while Saylor says the best strategy is to buy bitcoin and wait. It seems to have worked for him so far, with MicroStrategy more than doubling the $3.16 billion that it has invested into bitcoin.\\n\\nTrading #Bitcoin is like trading Apple, Amazon, Google, or Facebook a decade ago.

Bitcoins market cap also remains above $1 trillion, though the overall crypto market cap has fallen by just over 2 per cent to $2.29 trillion over the last 24 hours.\\n\\nHeres how the price chart looks for the last seven days, courtesy of CoinMarketCap. (CoinMarketCap)\\n\\nBitcoin price actually benefits from Chinese crackdown, expert claims\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 13:27 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nAfter bitcoin hit an all-time high of just above $64,000 in mid April, the cryptocurrency suffered one of the most devastating price crashes in its history that took it below $30,000.\\n\\nOne of the leading causes was Chinas crackdown on cryptocurrency, which forced miners - which made up more than 70 per cent of the network - to close operations and move out of the country. But while this had a negative impact on bitcoins price in the short term, some crypto experts believe it will actually be beneficial in the long run.\\n\\nPeriodic shock-tests seem to only make bitcoin grow stronger, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of the exchange Bitfinex, tells The Independent.\\n\\nThe hashrate is recovering to reach a near all-time high in the wake of the China ban... We see the king of crypto is once again showing its resilience. In the case of any ban or restrictions on bitcoin, there will always be someone left to fill the void. We expect to see others step up as Chinas power diminishes. This is a true testament to the far reach and resilience of the industry.\\n\\nFive countries will accept bitcoin as legal tender in 2022, crypto boss predicts\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 11:27 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nFollowing El Salvadors pioneering Bitcoin Law, which made the cryptocurrency legal tender in the Central American country last month, there has been a lot of speculation over which countries might follow suit.\\n\\nA bold new prediction has just come from Alex Hoeptner, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitmex, who believes that at least five countries will adopt bitcoin by the end of next year.\\n\\nHoeptner says all of them will be developing countries, citing remittance fees, inflation and politics as the three main factors driving the adoption.\\n\\nOver the next year, and as El Salvador works out the kinks in its rollout, savvy politicians will be thinking of how they can take a similar path, and how it might benefit both them and their constituents, he said. What El Salvador did is take the first leap of faith, making similar moves by other countries much easier to consider. (Getty Images)\\n\\nJPMorgans Jamie Dimon says bitcoin is worthless, exposing stark lack of knowledge\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 09:57 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he believes bitcoin is worthless, while also revealing that his clients disagree.\\n\\nHe said that JPMorgan will provide customers as-clean-as-possible access to bitcoin, saying that his personal opinion on the worlds most valuable cryptocurrency is irrelevant when there is such strong demand for it.\\n\\nIt is not the first time the controversial CEO has spoken out against bitcoin, though his latest comments have revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about the cryptocurrency. He questioned whether bitcoins fixed supply - no more than 21 million coins will ever exist - will magically increase in the future, asking: How do you know it ends at 21 million? You all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that? I dont know, Ive always been a skeptic of stuff like that?\\n\\nIf he bothered to read the algorithms himself, he would realise that it is just five lines of code that limit bitcoins supply.\\n\\nFive lines of code that results in 21m #Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/Isx8CTYMe0\\n\\n Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) October 12, 2021\\n\\nBitcoin ETF speculation pushing price up?\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 09:31 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nWidely reported speculation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is interested in four separate bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) is being cited as one of the driving factors behind the cryptocurrencys astonishing price rise since the start of October.\\n\\nWeve heard from Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of the crypto exchange CEX.IO, who says the rumours are just one of several factors pushing bitcoins price higher.\\n\\nHeres what he had to say:\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why bitcoin is currently experiencing a bullish surge.October has been a good month for crypto investors. El Salvadors move to adopt bitcoin as legal tender has been seen in a positive light.El Salvadors President, Nayib Bukele announced that they will use surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust to build a veterinary hospital. The use of bitcoin for such a noble cause has surely played a role in public approval and a gain in price.Another reason for Bitcoins increase in value is JPMorgans recent note to investors - it said that the prized crypto asset seems to be a better hedge against inflation than gold. I believe the latest bitcoin rally is a direct result of inflation concerns and investors are using the cryptocurrency as a hedge against it. The USs positive stance on cryptocurrencies in recent weeks is another contributing factor.The public sentiment is bullish at the moment and there appear to be no roadblocks in the near future. 2021 has been a topsy-turvy year for cryptocurrencies as is usually the case  we could be in for a good end to the year!\\n\\nKonstantin Anissimov, CEX.IO\\n\\nMystery whale buys $1.6 billion of bitcoin\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:58 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nA mysterious investor, or group of investors, has placed an order to buy $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nSuch a large volume trade has inevitably contributed to bitcoins price surge, pushing it above $57,000 for the first time since May.\\n\\nKi Young, a crypto analyst and CEO of on-chain data firm CryptoQuant, speculated that traders may be taking on large positions ahead of a rumoured approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This kind of announcement would be huge for bitcoin, and would almost certainly lead to fresh new price highs.\\n\\nBitcoin price closing in on ATH as crypto market closes in on Apple\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:51 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nBitcoin has risen by nearly a third in value since the start of the month, with the price gains pushing the overall crypto market cap above the value of tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently worth $2.32 trillion, meaning only Apple is worth more at $2.36 trillion.\\n\\nThe market value of bitcoin alone is more than $1 trillion, meaning one more price rally could push it above silver. Some analysts and investors, such as MicroStrategys Michael Saylor, believe the worlds most valuable cryptocurrency will one day flip gold, due to its inbuilt scarcity. That would put the price of a single bitcoin at around half a million dollars.

Given the size of the US ETF industry and current positivity in the market, following Chinas ban being put behind the public, El Salvadors good will  using surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust for noble purposes and the emergence of India as the country with most crypto users, among other reasons, I believe not only will bitcoin cross $60,000 but also break its all-time high this month and potentially surpass $65,000 by the end of the month.\\n\\nUnless some barriers to growth appear in the latter stages of the year, bitcoin is poised to reach $75,000 by the end of the year.\\n\\nGreg Waisman, Mercuryo\\n\\nBitcoin price set for record-breaking end to 2021?\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 10:45 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nOctober has historically been a positive month for bitcoin, averaging 13 per cent gains since 2011, though this is just a fraction of the price increase typically seen in November.\\n\\nWith nearly a 40 per cent price rise in October already, bitcoin is vastly outperforming the precedent.\\n\\nWere still only halfway through October, but if bitcoin stays at its current price and then replicates the average gains of previous years, it will reach six figures before Christmas.

But while this had a negative impact on bitcoins price in the short term, some crypto experts believe it will actually be beneficial in the long run.\\n\\nPeriodic shock-tests seem to only make bitcoin grow stronger, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of the exchange Bitfinex, tells The Independent.\\n\\nThe hashrate is recovering to reach a near all-time high in the wake of the China ban... We see the king of crypto is once again showing its resilience. In the case of any ban or restrictions on bitcoin, there will always be someone left to fill the void. We expect to see others step up as Chinas power diminishes.

What El Salvador did is take the first leap of faith, making similar moves by other countries much easier to consider.

He questioned whether bitcoins fixed supply - no more than 21 million coins will ever exist - will magically increase in the future, asking: How do you know it ends at 21 million? You all read the algorithms? You guys all believe that?

El Salvadors move to adopt bitcoin as legal tender has been seen in a positive light.El Salvadors President, Nayib Bukele announced that they will use surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust to build a veterinary hospital. The use of bitcoin for such a noble cause has surely played a role in public approval and a gain in price.Another reason for Bitcoins increase in value is JPMorgans recent note to investors - it said that the prized crypto asset seems to be a better hedge against inflation than gold. I believe the latest bitcoin rally is a direct result of inflation concerns and investors are using the cryptocurrency as a hedge against it. The USs positive stance on cryptocurrencies in recent weeks is another contributing factor.The public sentiment is bullish at the moment and there appear to be no roadblocks in the near future. 2021 has been a topsy-turvy year for cryptocurrencies as is usually the case  we could be in for a good end to the year!\\n\\nKonstantin Anissimov, CEX.IO\\n\\nMystery whale buys $1.6 billion of bitcoin\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:58 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nA mysterious investor, or group of investors, has placed an order to buy $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nSuch a large volume trade has inevitably contributed to bitcoins price surge, pushing it above $57,000 for the first time since May.\\n\\nKi Young, a crypto analyst and CEO of on-chain data firm CryptoQuant, speculated that traders may be taking on large positions ahead of a rumoured approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This kind of announcement would be huge for bitcoin, and would almost certainly lead to fresh new price highs.\\n\\nBitcoin price closing in on ATH as crypto market closes in on Apple\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:51 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nBitcoin has risen by nearly a third in value since the start of the month, with the price gains pushing the overall crypto market cap above the value of tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently worth $2.32 trillion, meaning only Apple is worth more at $2.36 trillion.\\n\\nThe market value of bitcoin alone is more than $1 trillion, meaning one more price rally could push it above silver. Some analysts and investors, such as MicroStrategys Michael Saylor, believe the worlds most valuable cryptocurrency will one day flip gold, due to its inbuilt scarcity. That would put the price of a single bitcoin at around half a million dollars.

One of the most prominent advocates of this bear market theory, the pseudonymous Mr Whale, seems to have been receiving a lot of comments on Twitter, judging by his latest tweet:\\n\\npic.twitter.com/MIAlxySvII\\n\\n Mr. Whale (@CryptoWhale) October 15, 2021\\n\\nBitcoin price finally breaks $60,000, with traders extremely bullish'\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 14:56 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nAfter teasing the $60,000 price mark all day, bitcoin has finally broken above it.\\n\\nThis is the first time since April that the worlds biggest cryptocurrency has reached this high, and breaching this milestone could prompt a significant price rally, according to one analyst.\\n\\nWill Morris, a sales trader at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, believes this could be the start of an extremely bullish phase for bitcoin.\\n\\nTraders previously suggested that for bitcoin to enter an extremely bullish phase and go parabolic it would need to break the $59-60k level, he tells The Independent.\\n\\nIf BTC breaks to $61k there could be minimal upside pressure. All-time highs of nearly $65k will be the next resistance level before a potential price discovery phase. While the BTC price has fiercely rallied over the past few weeks, bitcoin balance on exchanges remains at the lowest levels in nine months, indicating investors are holding bitcoin in wallets rather than readying themselves to sell.\\n\\nHow high could bitcoin price go?\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 13:31 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nDepending on who you ask, the answer to this question can range from $0 to north of $1 million.\\n\\nBut separating the so-called FUDsters from the Moon Boys are the more realistic crypto analysts, who put bitcoins price within a window of between $10,000 and $250,000 over the next year.\\n\\nOne of the most accurate forecasts made in recent months comes from the pseudonymous Dutch analyst PlanB, who predicted in June the price of bitcoin in August and September to within less than a third of a per cent.\\n\\nAccording to PlanBs worst case scenario, bitcoin will be at $63,000 at the end of October, before shooting up to $98,000 in November and $135,000 in December.

Heres what he had to say:\\n\\nThe $6.7 trillion US ETF industry is the largest market in the world  bitcoin frenzy may reach new heights in the near future.\\n\\nApproving futures-based bitcoin ETFs will be seen as a forward-thinking move by the SEC and could lead to a bullish run. Given the size of the US ETF industry and current positivity in the market, following Chinas ban being put behind the public, El Salvadors good will  using surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust for noble purposes and the emergence of India as the country with most crypto users, among other reasons, I believe not only will bitcoin cross $60,000 but also break its all-time high this month and potentially surpass $65,000 by the end of the month.\\n\\nUnless some barriers to growth appear in the latter stages of the year, bitcoin is poised to reach $75,000 by the end of the year.\\n\\nGreg Waisman, Mercuryo\\n\\nBitcoin price set for record-breaking end to 2021?\\n\\nFriday 15 October 2021 10:45 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nOctober has historically been a positive month for bitcoin, averaging 13 per cent gains since 2011, though this is just a fraction of the price increase typically seen in November.\\n\\nWith nearly a 40 per cent price rise in October already, bitcoin is vastly outperforming the precedent.\\n\\nWere still only halfway through October, but if bitcoin stays at its current price and then replicates the average gains of previous years, it will reach six figures before Christmas.

But while this had a negative impact on bitcoins price in the short term, some crypto experts believe it will actually be beneficial in the long run.\\n\\nPeriodic shock-tests seem to only make bitcoin grow stronger, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of the exchange Bitfinex, tells The Independent.\\n\\nThe hashrate is recovering to reach a near all-time high in the wake of the China ban... We see the king of crypto is once again showing its resilience. In the case of any ban or restrictions on bitcoin, there will always be someone left to fill the void. We expect to see others step up as Chinas power diminishes.

What El Salvador did is take the first leap of faith, making similar moves by other countries much easier to consider.

El Salvadors move to adopt bitcoin as legal tender has been seen in a positive light.El Salvadors President, Nayib Bukele announced that they will use surplus funds from The Bitcoin Trust to build a veterinary hospital. The use of bitcoin for such a noble cause has surely played a role in public approval and a gain in price.Another reason for Bitcoins increase in value is JPMorgans recent note to investors - it said that the prized crypto asset seems to be a better hedge against inflation than gold. I believe the latest bitcoin rally is a direct result of inflation concerns and investors are using the cryptocurrency as a hedge against it. The USs positive stance on cryptocurrencies in recent weeks is another contributing factor.The public sentiment is bullish at the moment and there appear to be no roadblocks in the near future. 2021 has been a topsy-turvy year for cryptocurrencies as is usually the case  we could be in for a good end to the year!\\n\\nKonstantin Anissimov, CEX.IO\\n\\nMystery whale buys $1.6 billion of bitcoin\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:58 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nA mysterious investor, or group of investors, has placed an order to buy $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nSuch a large volume trade has inevitably contributed to bitcoins price surge, pushing it above $57,000 for the first time since May.\\n\\nKi Young, a crypto analyst and CEO of on-chain data firm CryptoQuant, speculated that traders may be taking on large positions ahead of a rumoured approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This kind of announcement would be huge for bitcoin, and would almost certainly lead to fresh new price highs.\\n\\nBitcoin price closing in on ATH as crypto market closes in on Apple\\n\\nTuesday 12 October 2021 07:51 , Anthony Cuthbertson\\n\\nBitcoin has risen by nearly a third in value since the start of the month, with the price gains pushing the overall crypto market cap above the value of tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency market is currently worth $2.32 trillion, meaning only Apple is worth more at $2.36 trillion.\\n\\nThe market value of bitcoin alone is more than $1 trillion, meaning one more price rally could push it above silver. Some analysts and investors, such as MicroStrategys Michael Saylor, believe the worlds most valuable cryptocurrency will one day flip gold, due to its inbuilt scarcity. That would put the price of a single bitcoin at around half a million dollars.
